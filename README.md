# Corona-Virus-Flashcards
A centralised location to learn about topics not just to do with this Pandemic but also future outbreaks. Community driven!

## Introduction
This repository is the source code for the educational material of the Corona Virus Flashcards and which is in a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app.

## Notes
Please note the following
1. Every card has "(Corona Virus Flashcards)" appended to the end so that if you have any other virology related topics in your collection, our version will still be added when importing it.
2. Any updates, translations or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Corona-Virus-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Corona-Virus-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .csv file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be `|`.

## Contributing
Pull requests, corrections & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work  (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.

### Translating for other languages
Translations in all languages are welcome. Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day or night.

**Please prepend the tag `[lang-code]` to your issues and pull requests.** For example, `[fr]` for French. This will help everyone pick out things they care about.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more guidance and details for making a contribution.
