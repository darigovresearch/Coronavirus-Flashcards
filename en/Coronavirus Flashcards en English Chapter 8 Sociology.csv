Introduction to Chapter 8 Sociology (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with the Sociology of Virology
What is Sociology? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Sociology is the study of human behaviour
How does Sociology pertain to everyday life? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Understanding human behaviour means you can work better together in teams to solve problems more effectively
Why is it important to know about the field of Sociology to do with viruses? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|The way that people behave and interact forms a big part of the way diseases spread, understanding more about Sociology allows you to better solutions to an outbreak
How does Sociology impact the rollout of initial measures against at the start of a viral outbreak? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|At the start of an outbreak containment and tracing is very important as when there are very few cases you have less cases to track so understanding how people behave in these cases can help reduce the spread of an outbreak
How does Sociology impact the rollout of later measures against a viral outbreak? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Towards the end of a pandemic testing, tracing and treatment becomes a bigger concern so encouraging people to take a vaccine or get help when they exhibit symptoms is very important
What are some of the main paradigms in Sociology? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|You can split them into classical theories and 20th century social theories; some examples of classical theories are Functionalism, Conflict theory, Symbolic Interactionism and Utilitarianism and some examples of 20th century social theories are Pax Wisconsana, Structuralism and Post-structuralism
What are some of the sampling methods in Sociology? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Sampling is when you try to get a relevant subset of the population, ideally it is best to have a random sample but sometimes this is too difficult or unfeasible so other methods such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling can be used
How has computational Sociology brought some insights into the field of Sociology? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|You can model computationally some parts of human behaviour and therefore run various computational models with adjustments in these sociological variables to see how these effect the spread of an outbreak
How do Socio-Economic factors come into play during a pandemic? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|When someone does not have access to paid sick leave for example they are more likely to risk coming in to work if they exhibit symptoms
How can we help reduce the effects of Socio-Economic factors with respect to a pandemic? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Having mandatory paid sick leave from all employers and a living wage being paid to everyone would helpful along with equal access to healthcare would reduce the likelihood that someone will come into work when exhibiting symptoms
