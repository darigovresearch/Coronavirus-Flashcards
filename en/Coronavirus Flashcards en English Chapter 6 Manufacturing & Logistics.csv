Introduction to Chapter 6 Manufacturing & Logistics (Coronavirus Flashcards)|This chapter contains content to do with Manufacturing and Logistics when an outbreak of a virus occurs
Why is Manufacturing & Logistics important in times of a pandemic? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Being able to create and correctly distribute manufactured products helps ensure that everyone gets what they need when they need it and can help reduce unnecessary deaths where someone would have survived if essential tools and equipment were there for them
How has 3D printing been used during the Covid-19 pandemic? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Designs for 3D printed face shields and a community led support structure allowed for the supply of vital protective equipment for frontline workers for higher volume manufacturing methods to get up and running
How are vaccines usually manufactured? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|The steps are usually generation of the antigen, isolation of the antigen from the growing medium, it then may be inactivated if required, then mixed with stabilisers or preservatives and bottled and packaged
How are vaccines distributed across a population? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|It depends on who the vaccine was designed for and the requirements for storage (such as for it to be in a regular fridge or a -80), some people will be given priority such as at risk groups and key workers such as medical professionals
Why is it important to be able to consistently distribute PPE? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Protection for frontline staff is crucial so they are able to protect themselves in order to help others, if a key worker is ill they will not be able to help the most vulnerable which may cause unpredictable consequences
What are common methods of sterilising manufactured equipment? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Similar to medical equipment there is thermal, chemical and irradiation (using microwaves)
What makes medical devices more complex to manufacture? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|They usually must pass a higher standard of quality than non-medical devices which causes additional, more complex manufacturing methods and testing procedures
What are common standards that manufactured products must adhere to? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Depending on which region of the world and what product you are making it will be different, for example CE certification in the European Union
Why is it important to think about the end of life of a product when making or purchasing a product? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|Knowing how a product will be disposed means that the designer/manufacturer can make it easier to extract any resources if any, for example making a product reusable or have clear labelling so they can be recycled or turned into another value-add product
Why is it important (when possible) to be able to manufacture a medical device at a low price for the end user? (Coronavirus Flashcards)|For every 0 you add to the end of the price of a medical device it means that you limit the number of people that will be able to access the device, the lower the cost the more people will be able to benefit from the creation of the medical device
